# Security Policy

## Scope

This policy applies to the `lexatlas-website` project.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities

We strongly encourage responsible disclosure. Please report suspected vulnerabilities via:

- GitHub Security Advisories (preferred)

Please include as much detail as possible: steps to reproduce, affected versions, impact, and any proof-of-concept.

## Our Response SLAs

- We acknowledge new reports within 48 hours.
- We aim to resolve Critical severity issues within 14 days, and High severity issues as quickly as possible thereafter.

We will provide status updates as we investigate and remediate.

## Automated Security Scanning

We use automated scanners to help keep the project safe, including Secretlint, Semgrep, and dependency license checks. These tools are not a replacement for responsible disclosure. If you discover an issue, please report it using the methods above.

Thank you for helping keep our community safe.
