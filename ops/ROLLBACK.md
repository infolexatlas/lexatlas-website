## Emergency Contacts

- **Dev Lead**: [Name] - [Phone] - [Email]
- **DevOps Lead**: [Name] - [Phone] - [Email]
- **Product Owner**: [Name] - [Phone] - [Email]

## Rollback Decision Matrix

| Issue Severity | Response Time | Rollback Method | Approval Required |
|----------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Critical (Site down, data loss) | < 5 minutes | Immediate rollback | Dev Lead |
| High (Major functionality broken) | < 15 minutes | Quick rollback | Dev Lead |
| Medium (Minor issues) | < 1 hour | Planned rollback | Product Owner |
| Low (Cosmetic issues) | < 24 hours | Next deployment | Product Owner |

## Rollback Methods

### Method 1: Vercel Dashboard (Recommended)

**Use when**: You have access to Vercel dashboard and need immediate rollback.

1. **Access Vercel Dashboard**
   - Go to [Vercel Dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
   - Navigate to the `lexatlas-website` project

2. **View Deployments**
   - Click on "Deployments" tab
   - Find the last successful deployment (green checkmark)
   - Note the deployment URL and commit SHA

3. **Promote Previous Deployment**
   - Click on the three dots menu next to the last successful deployment
   - Select "Promote to Production"
   - Confirm the promotion

4. **Verify Rollback**
   - Wait 2-3 minutes for propagation
   - Test the site: `https://lex-atlas.com`
   - Run smoke tests: `BASE_URL=https://lex-atlas.com bash scripts/smoke-tests.sh`

### Method 2: Vercel CLI (Command Line)

**Use when**: You have Vercel CLI access and need programmatic rollback.

1. **Install Vercel CLI** (if not already installed)
   ```bash
   npm install -g vercel@latest
   ```

2. **Login to Vercel**
   ```bash
   vercel login
   ```

3. **List Deployments**
   ```bash
   vercel ls --scope=your-org-id
   ```

4. **Promote Previous Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Find the deployment ID of the last successful deployment
   vercel promote [DEPLOYMENT_ID] --prod
   ```

5. **Verify Rollback**
   ```bash
   # Test the site
   curl -I https://lex-atlas.com
   
   # Run smoke tests
   BASE_URL=https://lex-atlas.com bash scripts/smoke-tests.sh
   ```

### Method 3: GitHub Actions (Automated)

**Use when**: You want to trigger a rollback through GitHub Actions.

1. **Create Rollback Branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b hotfix/rollback-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
   git push origin hotfix/rollback-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S)
   ```

2. **Create Pull Request**
   - Create a PR from the rollback branch to main
   - Title: "ðŸš¨ HOTFIX: Rollback to [COMMIT_SHA]"
   - Description: Include reason for rollback and impact assessment

3. **Merge PR**
   - Get approval from Dev Lead
   - Merge PR to trigger automatic deployment

### Method 4: Manual Redeploy (Last Resort)

**Use when**: All other methods fail and you need to redeploy from a specific commit.

1. **Identify Last Good Commit**
   ```bash
   git log --oneline -10
   # Find the commit SHA of the last working deployment
   ```

2. **Redeploy from Commit**
   ```bash
   # Checkout the last good commit
   git checkout [COMMIT_SHA]
   
   # Deploy to production
   vercel deploy --prod --prebuilt -m "Rollback to [COMMIT_SHA]"
   ```

3. **Verify Deployment**
   ```bash
   # Test the site
   curl -I https://lex-atlas.com
   
   # Run smoke tests
   BASE_URL=https://lex-atlas.com bash scripts/smoke-tests.sh
   ```

- [ ] **Training**: Conduct team training on rollback procedures

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue: Vercel Dashboard Not Accessible
