**GitHub Actions:** https://github.com/infolexatlas/lexatlas-website/actions/runs/17822727236

## Critical Issues Found

### üö® CRITICAL: Kit Page Metadata Failure
- **Issue:** All kit pages are showing generic kits listing metadata instead of individual kit metadata
- **Impact:** SEO disaster - all kit pages have identical titles, descriptions, and canonical URLs

### üö® CRITICAL: Missing JSON-LD
- **Issue:** Product JSON-LD is not being generated for kit pages
- **Impact:** Rich snippets and structured data missing for all kit pages
- **Expected:** Product schema with price, currency, availability, etc.

### üö® CRITICAL: Wrong Canonical URLs
- **Issue:** All kit pages show canonical URL as `/kits` instead of `/kits/fra-xxx`
- **Impact:** SEO duplicate content issues

### Other Pages - ‚úÖ WORKING
- Homepage: ‚úÖ 200 OK, correct metadata
- Kits listing: ‚úÖ 200 OK, correct metadata  
- Pricing: ‚úÖ 200 OK (canonical issue noted)
- Sitemap: ‚úÖ 200 OK
- Robots.txt: ‚úÖ 200 OK

### API Endpoints - ‚ùå FAILED
- /api/vitals: ‚ùå Failed after 3 retries

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue appears to be in the dynamic route implementation. The `generateMetadata` function in `/src/app/kits/[slug]/page.tsx` is not being called correctly, causing all kit pages to fall back to the parent route's metadata.

**Likely causes:**
1. Static generation not working properly with new short slugs
2. `generateMetadata` function not being invoked for dynamic routes
3. Build-time metadata generation failing silently

## Redirect Testing - ‚è≥ NOT TESTED
Due to critical metadata issues, redirect testing was not performed. The redirects may work, but the destination pages are broken.

## Security Headers - ‚úÖ PRESENT
- Strict-Transport-Security: ‚úÖ
- X-Content-Type-Options: ‚úÖ  
- X-Frame-Options: ‚úÖ
- Referrer-Policy: ‚úÖ
- Permissions-Policy: ‚úÖ

## Sitemap Ping - ‚è≥ NOT TESTED
Due to critical issues, sitemap pinging was not performed.

## Acceptance Criteria Status

| Criteria | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| All 10 kit URLs return 200 | ‚úÖ | Pages load but with wrong content |
| Unique titles/metas | ‚ùå | All show generic kits listing metadata |
| Canonical URLs exact | ‚ùå | All point to `/kits` instead of `/kits/fra-xxx` |
| Product JSON-LD valid | ‚ùå | Missing entirely |
| 301 redirects work | ‚è≥ | Not tested due to critical issues |
| Smoke tests pass 100% | ‚ùå | 43% pass rate (42/74 failed) |
| Post-deploy pass 100% | ‚ùå | Not run due to critical issues |

## Immediate Actions Required

1. **ROLLBACK DEPLOYMENT** - Revert to previous working version
2. **Fix Dynamic Route Metadata** - Debug `generateMetadata` function
3. **Fix Static Generation** - Ensure `generateStaticParams` works with short slugs
4. **Test Locally** - Verify all kit pages generate correct metadata
5. **Re-deploy** - Only after all issues are resolved

## GO/NO-GO Decision

### ‚ùå NO-GO - CRITICAL ISSUES FOUND

**Rationale:**
- All 10 kit pages have identical, incorrect metadata
- SEO impact is severe - duplicate content across all kit pages
- JSON-LD structured data missing entirely
- Canonical URLs pointing to wrong pages
- API endpoints failing

**Risk Assessment:**
- **SEO Impact:** CRITICAL - All kit pages will be penalized for duplicate content
- **User Experience:** SEVERE - Users see wrong titles and descriptions
- **Business Impact:** HIGH - Kit pages are primary revenue drivers

**Next Steps:**
1. Immediately rollback to previous deployment
2. Fix dynamic route metadata generation
3. Test thoroughly in staging environment
4. Re-deploy only after all issues resolved
